# Puzzles

A demo full stack project for coding challenges.

## Features

-   Highly over engineered project to demonstrate real world use of semi-large architecture for scalability and maintainability.
-   Use of Hangfire for processing server tasks in the background like Knight Moves, the first coding challenge added.
-   Custom four stage object mapper (spauldo_techture).
-   Entity framework migrations for easy database setups.
-   View the live project here: [puzzles.spauldoindustries.com](https://puzzles.spauldoindustries.com)

## Tech Stack

-   server side:
    -   dotnet core/c#
    -   mysql
    -   rocky linux
    -   nginx
-   client side:
    -   react
    -   javascript
    -   vite

## Spauldo Techture?

This project is dependent on a class library that has been in development during my spare time.
It is an experimental project aimed at optimizing architecture workflow through custom object mapping, logic, validation and more.
You can view the source code here: [spauldo_techture](https://github.com/Spauldo-Industries/spauldo-tecture).

## Future Work

-   Client side face lift.
